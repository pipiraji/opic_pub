<p>My name is Pil-Won. I am 41 years old and I live with my family -I have my lovely wife and daughter.  I’ve worked for this company for more than 18 years.  I am an engineer.   There are many challenges so I always study for my job.  Besides, whenever I have spare time, I try to do some sports.  For example, I go swimming during my lunch time because I don’t have enough time to exercise after work. That is how I maintain my health. </p>
<br/>
<p>(Well) The place I live in is a 3 bedroom apartment in Dontan, South Korea.  It takes about 30 minutes away from Seoul.  (Umm) There’s well developed infrastructure around my apartment.  For example, I have schools, department stores and a movie theatre near my house. Especially, (you know) there’s a park where I enjoy my time jogging there.  So it’s my favorite place.  In my house I have three bedrooms - master bedroom for my wife and me and the rest of them is for my daughter.  She uses one for herself and the other for her studying.  I usually stay in the living room and study in my daughter’s studying room at night.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Okay Avar. Let me see. Well,   I’ll tell you about the differences between my neighborhood in the past and that in nowadays. </p>
<p>Let’s start how it used to be.  I was born in the countryside, South Korea. As you know. The countryside is not a developed area. There were a few houses in my town. Moreover my house is surrounded by nature. For example, I had mountains, streams and farmland near my house. Thanks to this, I always enjoyed refreshing air or clean water. And I knew almost all of the neighborhoods in my town. In addition, all people helped each other and did many things together.  We trusted each other.</p>
<p>In contrast , nowadays.   I live in an apartment complex in the city. My apartment is surrounded by modern construction. For example, I have hospitals, department stores, schools and parks near my place. Not to mention, There are many people living in the apartment.  So  I have more neighbors than ever before. But it seems like none of them is close to me because we just say hello to each other. </p>
<p>I know Avar. what you think about it. It’s a bit sad, but it’s the reality. That’s all.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Well Ava, I guess what I’m trying to say is that I don’t really interact with my neighbors in my apartment complex.  I mean, there’s not much to say about them, you know? Sorry about that but let me tell you about a friend from my childhood. As I mentioned, I was brought up in the countryside. My friend and I were born and grew up in the same town. There wasn’t a playground or anything like that, so everywhere kind of became our playground, and we would run around together. I sometimes miss those days and my friend. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>That&#x27;s an interesting question. Avar. Yes,  I enjoy watching movies in my home. Because I installed a projector in the living room. When I watch movies, I can focus on it. So I feel relaxed. </p>
<p>I like many different movie genres.  Among them, my favorite is blockbusters like Marvel movies that have amazing special effects and connected stories. That’s why I love Marvel movies and I wonder what’s next. </p>
<p>The most memorable movie I’ve seen is Avengers, which has many heroes, and it was interesting to see so many of them together in one place. </p>
<p>That’s all, Avar. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p> Let me see…  Ok! I will start now. </p>
<p>I like going to the movie theater with my family, which is near my house and located in the shopping mall called Time Terrace . It takes about 10 minutes on foot to get there only. First  I booked tickets using my smartphone in advance because I can select the time and seats. I usually arrive at the movie theater about 30 minutes before the movie starts.  When I arrive there, I change tickets from the kiosk, and then I buy popcorn and coke. Of Course I will not forget to go to the restroom. After watching the movie, I usually go to a restaurant with my family and talk about the movie. </p>
<p>That’s about my routine.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Well, Let me think about that for a moment. My favorite actor is Christian Bale who starred  in “The Dark Knight” 10 years ago. He played Batman. Yes,  I’ve never seen a more perfect Batman that showed both dynamic actions and growth. Besides I also got impressed because he changed into a future soldier called “John Connor”  in “Terminator 4”. </p>
<p>In conclusion, He is really talented. In addition, He alway do his best, so it is the reason why I like him. </p>
