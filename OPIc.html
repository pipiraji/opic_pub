<p>My name is Pil-Won. I am 41 years old and I live with my family -I have my lovely wife and daughter.  I’ve worked for this company for more than 18 years.  I am an engineer.   There are many challenges so I always study for my job.  Besides, whenever I have spare time, I try to do some sports.  For example, I go swimming during my lunch time because I don’t have enough time to exercise after work. That is how I maintain my health. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>(Well) The place I live in is a 3 bedroom apartment in Dontan, South Korea.  It takes about 30 minutes away from Seoul.  (Umm) There’s well developed infrastructure around my apartment.  For example, I have schools, department stores and a movie theatre near my house. Especially, (you know) there’s a park where I enjoy my time jogging there.  So it’s my favorite place.  In my house I have three bedrooms - master bedroom for my wife and me and the rest of them is for my daughter.  She uses one for herself and the other for her studying.  I usually stay in the living room and study in my daughter’s studying room at night.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Okay Avar. Let me see. Well,   I’ll tell you about the differences between my neighborhood in the past and that in nowadays. </p>
<p>Let’s start how it used to be.  I was born in the countryside, South Korea. As you know. The countryside is not a developed area. There were a few houses in my town. Moreover my house is surrounded by nature. For example, I had mountains, streams and farmland near my house. Thanks to this, I always enjoyed refreshing air or clean water. And I knew almost all of the neighborhoods in my town. In addition, all people helped each other and did many things together.  We trusted each other.</p>
<p>In contrast , nowadays.   I live in an apartment complex in the city. My apartment is surrounded by modern construction. For example, I have hospitals, department stores, schools and parks near my place. Not to mention, There are many people living in the apartment.  So  I have more neighbors than ever before. But it seems like none of them is close to me because we just say hello to each other. </p>
<p>I know Avar. what you think about it. It’s a bit sad, but it’s the reality. That’s all.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Well Ava, I guess what I’m trying to say is that I don’t really interact with my neighbors in my apartment complex.  I mean, there’s not much to say about them, you know? Sorry about that but let me tell you about a friend from my childhood. As I mentioned, I was brought up in the countryside. My friend and I were born and grew up in the same town. There wasn’t a playground or anything like that, so everywhere kind of became our playground, and we would run around together. I sometimes miss those days and my friend. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>That&#x27;s an interesting question. Avar. Yes,  I enjoy watching movies in my home. Because I installed a projector in the living room. When I watch movies, I can focus on it. So I feel relaxed. </p>
<p>I like many different movie genres.  Among them, my favorite is blockbusters like Marvel movies that have amazing special effects and connected stories. That’s why I love Marvel movies and I wonder what’s next. </p>
<p>The most memorable movie I’ve seen is Avengers, which has many heroes, and it was interesting to see so many of them together in one place. </p>
<p>That’s all, Avar. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p> Let me see…  Ok! I will start now. </p>
<p>I like going to the movie theater with my family, which is near my house and located in the shopping mall called Time Terrace . It takes about 10 minutes on foot to get there only. First  I booked tickets using my smartphone in advance because I can select the time and seats. I usually arrive at the movie theater about 30 minutes before the movie starts.  When I arrive there, I change tickets from the kiosk, and then I buy popcorn and coke. Of Course I will not forget to go to the restroom. After watching the movie, I usually go to a restaurant with my family and talk about the movie. </p>
<p>That’s about my routine.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Well, Let me think about that for a moment. My favorite actor is Christian Bale who starred  in “The Dark Knight” 10 years ago. He played Batman. Yes,  I’ve never seen a more perfect Batman that showed both dynamic actions and growth. Besides I also got impressed because he changed into a future soldier called “John Connor”  in “Terminator 4”. </p>
<p>In conclusion, He is really talented. In addition, He alway do his best, so it is the reason why I like him. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I love many different music genres. Among them, my favorite is the Korean ballads that have beautiful lyrics and melodies. When I listen to ballads, I feel relaxed and at peace.  In addition, My favorite singer is kim-kwanng-seock who was singer-songwriter in korea. The first time I heard his song was on a movie soundtrack.His songs made the movie more impressive.  Although I can’t hear his new songs anymore, he will always be my best singer. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I usually listen to music in my car when I am driving with my family. Unfortunately  My car is old. So there is no bluetooth function in my car. But I can connect to my smartphone via a usb-cable.  Because I am the driver of a car, my daughter selects music that is usually  upbeat. Thanks to the upbeat music, I can drive without getting bored. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>My favorite song is “ETA” by NewJeans who are  a popular k-pop idol group. Their songs have both nostalgic and modern emotions, which is why people of all ages like them. “ETA” has a fast tempo and exciting melody. I  listened to it many times when I went on vacation with my family last year on the big-island Hawaii USA. I rented a car and spent lots of time driving. for a long time. Thanks to this song, I didn’t get bored while driving.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I like going to ‘Sowon’ when I have a time which has various interesting things.  First of all, there are many historical places. Such as  ‘Hawsung’, ‘Hawsing’ is the oldest city wall. But it is still strong and many people visit there.</p>
<p>Next, There are many modern restaurants. I can enjoy both eastern and western food in one place. </p>
<p>Moreover, There are little prop shops. My daughter loves to look at props because they are so cute. </p>
<p>It is my favorite place in my country. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Before I travel, I usually prepare a few important things to make the trip more comfortable. </p>
<p>Since I can&#x27;t remember all the items, I search a cross check list from the internet and print it.  But items that I will never forget are a charger and a camera. </p>
<p>First of all, I have many electric devices that always need to charge. The charger is a very essential item.</p>
<p> Second, I love to take pictures. Although I can take a picture with my smartphone, I prefer taking pictures using a camera to using a smartphone.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The first trip I went on was “Zhangjiajie”  in China with my family 20 years ago, which is famous for natural scenery. </p>
<p>Besides, it became more famous after the movie “Avatar”.</p>
<p>Since we booked a package tour, they took care of the transportation or meals. </p>
<p>So it was really helpful for the trip. Thanks to that, we enjoyed the beautiful landscape there. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The memorable trip in my life was my honeymoon with my wife when I was 30 years old. </p>
<p>We decided to go to “Mauritius” which is an island in the Indian ocean. Mauritius has a lot of activities and a great landscape.  </p>
<p>We stayed for 10 nights, but it was too short to enjoy everything.  If I get a chance to go again, I will.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I will tell you about my experience with the weather.  When I was an elementary school student, I lived in the countryside.  Besides, I walked 30 mins to get to school everyday. </p>
<p>One day, It rained heavily overnight during the rainy season. </p>
<p>Finally, the town where my school is located flooded. </p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t go to school by walking, So I stayed at home for two days.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I think that my wife is a healthy person. Right. She always tries to stay healthy. I will tell you how she does for a healthy life. First of all, She works out at the gym everyday with a personal trainer in the morning.  Moreover She go swimming  and takes lessons in the evening twice a week. And she tries to eat healthy food. For Example, she prepares her lunchbox with fresh vegetables or grilled chicken breast for her lunch in the office. Lastly, she goes to bed at 10pm.  It makes her healthier. I think.</p>
<br/>
<p>Yes. I will tell you about how to maintain my health. I am a hard working engineer.  I mean , I don’t have enough time to exercise after work.  So I go swimming during lunch time. There is a swimming pool in my office, so I can save time to get there. Thanks to this, I usually swim for about 30 minutes. After that I eat my lunch.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing that for 10 years now. That is how to maintain my health. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I think that Korea has a lot of hotels everywhere.  I can find business hotels near downtown, and luxury hotels near mountains or beaches. The business hotel has a small and  simple room. They have some rooms for business work, like an office or meeting room and they also offer breakfast too. In contrast, The luxury hotel has more convenience facilities. For example, they have a spa, pool, sauna, buffet and bars. </p>
<p>So you can select a hotel based on the purpose of your stay</p>
<br/>
<p>When I visited Hawaii last year with my family, I stayed at the Hyatt hotel in front of the beach for 5 nights. The location was perfect for water activities like snorkeling. Moreover, we could go to the beach easily.  We really enjoyed our vacation. However, My daughter’s small doll went missing in the room 1 day before our departure. I left a message to a hotel manager. but unfortunately, we came back home without a doll. Anyway, luckily, my daughter got a new one So it all worked out in the end. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I usually stay at the hotel when I go on vacation with my family. When I get there, the first thing I do is to go to frontdesk and check in my room. I always book in advance, so I  hand over my reservation paper and credit card to the hotelier. After getting my room cards, I go to my room and open the curtain because it is mostly closed. And then I unpack my bags, and take out a few essentials, like my charger, USB cables, and toothbrush. After that, before I go out for sightseeing I take a rest  for a moment in my room.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The first time I visited a dental clinic was when I was 24 years old. </p>
<p>It was at a dental clinic near Aju University. I went there because I found out that there were some holes in my teeth.. I could actually feel the hole with my tongue. </p>
<p>I went alone to the clinic, but I wasn’t scared at all. I know that many people feel nervous about going to see the dentist, especially because of the drilling sound, but that wasn’t for me.</p>
<br/>
<p>I can’t remember exactly now  but it was such a pleasant experience.. </p>
<p>During the treatment, the dentist and staff were friendly, and I felt comfortable throughout the whole process</p>
<br/>
<p>After the treatment, my cavities were gone, and the holes in my teeth were filled. It was such a relief to have everything taken care of, and I haven’t had any issues with my teeth since then.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>In the past, dental clinics were much more relaxed. You didn’t need an appointment; you could just walk in. Also, the environment was friendlier, with more personal interaction between the dentist and patients. </p>
<p>However, clinics today are much busier and appointments are must, and the atmosphere is less interactive. But the best thing about clinics nowadays is they are equipped with advanced technology like X-rays. This makes treatments and the process very fast.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>South Korea has two big traditional holidays. one is lunar new year’s called 설날 and the other is thanks giving day called 추석. Most people in South Korea gather in their hometown. For this reason, it is too difficult to buy a ticket for transportation during this season. And the rest of the people take their cars. But they are usually stuck in heavy traffic. Anyway, We do some activities that we do together.  First of all, We cook traditional Korean holiday food and eat together. such as Korean pizza called 전, korea spaghetti called 잡채 , and Korea rice soup called 떡국.  And We also do traditional activities. There are many games, among them I usually enjoy korea board game called 윳놀이 and kite. Lastly we do rites to show respect to our ancestors.  These are about South Korea’s holidays. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I will tell you about Lunar New Year&#x27;s.  As I said, Korea has two big holidays.  but I think, Lunar new year has more meaning to me because the new year means starting a new plan again. Moreover, we have Korean rice soup only this holiday. we believe that we get one year older after eating a rice soup.  When I was young. I ate two or three rice soups because of this reason.  It’s funny. </p>
<p>It is about special holiday food for the Lunar New Year. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Oh! sorry. I can’t remember my holiday experience when I was a child.  so I will tell you about my daughter when she was a baby. For the holiday, my family ,my wife and my daughter, visited my hometown. My hometown is located in the countryside. It means, There was no hospital near my hometown. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, my daughter had a fever upto 39 degrees, so I couldn&#x27;t do anything there.  So , I had to come back to my house and bring her to the hospital and we saw a doctor right away.  After that she was okay after taking a medicine-629 and then my family stayed at my house during the holiday. </p>
<br/>
<p>That was an unforgettable experience.</p>
