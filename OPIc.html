<p>I am not picky about movies. </p>
<p>I mean, I just watch whatever is fun and doing well at the box office. </p>
<p>Also, I often pick big-scale newly-released movies. </p>
<p>I like Sci-Fi, action, drama and animated movies but I don’t like horror. </p>
<p>Watching Sci-Fi and action movies makes my stress go away. They are fun and entertaining. </p>
<p>Dramas have heart-touching stories. so they are touching. </p>
<p>Animated movies are fun and educational. </p>

<p>There is a small island on the lake. </p>
<p>There are many flowers and trees along the lake. Many families enjoy the view while picnicking. </p>
<p>Along the lake, there is a nice working path.</p>

<p>I will tell you about my current house and old house. </p>
<p>There are many differences between my current house and my old house. </p>
<p>Let me start with my old house. </p>
<p>When I was young, I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment with my parents, brother and sister. </p>
<p>The apartment is on the 2nd floor and it was a bit small. </p>
<p>Plus, I had to share my bedroom with my brother. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I now live in a 3-bedroom apartment with my wife and a daughter. </p>
<p>It is much bigger than the old house. </p>
<p>I share my bedroom with my wife, but I have my own study room. </p>
<p>The apartment is on the 10th floor. The view is also much better. I can see a part behind the apartment building. </p>
<p>I like my current house because it’s specious. </p>
<p>That’s all about my current house and old house. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>내가 집에 준 변화 </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I will tell you what changes I made to my home. </p>
<p>I bought a sofa and a table two weeks ago. </p>
<p>I rearranged all of the furniture in my living room. </p>
<p>It took me almost 3 hours to finish. </p>
<p>Finally the living room looks much bigger and better now. </p>
<p>Plus I bought some house plants and put them in the living room. </p>
<p>My wife and I spend more time in the living room after all. </p>
<p>These are the changes I made to my home recently. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>은행</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>I will tell you about banks in Korea. </p>
<p>There are over 100 banks including commercial banks, mutual savings banks and specialized banks. </p>
<p>Among them the big four are Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori and Hana Bank. </p>
<p>We can easily find banks downtown. They are much like banks in other countries.</p>
<p>When I walk into a bank, the first thing I can see is the lobby area with some benches and magazines. I take a waiting number and wait for my turn there.</p>
<p>When my number is called, I go to a bank window and take care of my business with a teller. There are tellers sitting behind the windows. </p>
<p>Banks are open from 9 am to 4 pm Monday through Friday. This is about banks in Korea.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>People go to banks to take care of various things.</p>
<p>First of all, I can open or close an account. Also, I go there to check my balance, deposit, transfer of withdraw money.</p>
<p>Before travelling abroad, I exchange foreign currency there.</p>
<p>Moreover, I can apply for a credit card or a loan.</p>
<p>Lastly, I can pay the bills or traffic tickets there.</p>
<p>I do many different things at the bank and the tellers are very friendly and helpful.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The way we bank has changed radically over the years. </p>
<p>If you wanted to transfer money, it meant a trip to a bank. </p>
<p>However, people don’t go to a bank anymore to do it. </p>
<p>We use online banking and mobile banking. </p>
<p>Most banks have their own app and offer the internet banking service, so I can do banking on my phone wherever I am, wherever I want to.</p>
<p>Internet banking can be used to manage our everyday banking, open accounts, transfer money and check the balance.</p>
<p>I think it is most remarkable changes regarding banking.</p>

<p>티켓 / 정보</p>
<p>Hi! I’m a person who wants to book tickets for four. </p>
<p>So I need to get some information from you. So can I ask questions / related to the performance/movie? oh.. okay.</p>
<p>To be honest, the day is one of my best friends birthday. So I want to celebrate her birthday at a special place like theater. </p>
<p>So I want to sit in front row or VIP as closest as possible from the stage. So do you have any seats available? (븨아피)</p>
<p>Oh, then can I book the seats? That sounds good.</p>
<p>Then... how much is it to buy the tickets?</p>
<p>Oh... It’s so expensive. Then do you have any promotion going on currently?</p>
<p>Wow. It’s a nice thing. Thanks. </p>
<p>Last of all, I’m looking for a fancy restaurant for dinner with my friends after watching movie. </p>
<p>Can you recommend the restaurant nearby?</p>
<p>Wow. Thanks for letting me know, bye.</p>

<p>티켓 / 문제</p>
<p>Hi! I’m a person who bought a ticket on your ticket box this afternoon. </p>
<p>But when I got home after buying the ticket, I recognized that there’s something wrong with the ticket. </p>
<p>The date on the ticket was the problem. I was supposed to watch it on the weekend but it was the ticket for Friday. </p>
<p>To deal with the problem, here are some suggestions I can come up with.</p>
<p>First, can I get a full refund? I think it’ll be better just changing the date instead of a full refund. </p>
<p>But, I don’t have enough time to search better seat on your theater and the day is very important to me and my friends.</p>
<p>If it isn’t possible, please let me know if there are the tickets with the same seats and prices possible. </p>
<p>And I need to go there if I get a full refund or exchange. </p>
<p>So is there any parking lot? I should take my car when I go there after getting off work.</p>
<p>I hope this situation will be resolved well. Thank you, bye.</p>

<p>Hi Jenny. I’m jihye. I’m so sorry to tell you this, but I have a problem with working. </p>

<p> Hi! Andy? I’m Jihye. I want to get some information about mp3 because I want to buy a new mp3 released from Samsung. </p>
<p>I don’t know about the specific difference with previous model. </p>
<p>I heard from Jenny that you already bought the mp3 devices. Haha.. So I have some questions.</p>
<p>First, do you know what price range is?</p>
<p>I live on a tight budget, I need something affordable. So, is there any promotions going on currently? </p>
<p>And what kind of colors did you buy? Silver? Is it awesome? Wow.. Actually silver is my favorite color, too. </p>
<p>Does it come in that color? If it does, I’ll definitely go with it.</p>
<p>Also how big is it? If possible, I want a small size.</p>

<p>물건/대안</p>
<p>Hi Andy. I’m jihye. </p>
<p>I’m so sorry to tell you this, but I have a problem with your MP3 player. </p>
<p>Yesterday, I was on the way to work while listening to music with your mp3. </p>
<p>I suddenly got hit by a wall, right I didn’t see the wall. So I dropped your mp3 so It was broken..</p>
<p>I think it needs to get repaired at the center or it’s better to buy new one.</p>
<p>So..here are some suggestions to make up for it.</p>
<p>If you want to fix the devices, I will visit a/s center and bring to you after repairing it. </p>
<p>Absolutely I’ll pay repair costs. </p>
<p>If you want to buy new one, please let me know if you have any model in your mind and color.</p>
<p>I’ll buy new one. </p>
<p>And if you have another idea, feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>I’m so sorry again for this inconvenience.</p>
